Listen to the silent night while madam walks in level calm light
The racecar zoomed past civic buildings where deed and peep were whispered
Might the bright knight fight the light with a tight insight tonight
Below the elbow flows the state with calm level civic people talking
Dusty study rooms were full of students and tutors solving palindromes
The moonlight shone bright as they write right rhymes at night
Live and evil mirrored each other while Hannah drew on radar
Form from the farm where words and sword danced before noon
The looped deed was never undone as pop faced the noon sun
They noted tone in silent places where the refer madam smiled
Tap and pat the part where stressed desserts are drawn backward
We saw was a moment of level deed done under noon sun
Trace and cater to the stale tales of nightâ€™s light insight
Draw onward with radar senses as Anna reads civic texts calmly
Top spot was held by Bob who won with a wow and level
